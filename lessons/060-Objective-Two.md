# Primary job roles

> Estimated Reading Time: 5 minutes

The separation of responsibilities according to job roles is a key part of the Scrum framework. There are 3 job roles that Scrum mainly focuses on. These are:

* Product Owner
* Scrum Master
* Development Team

### Product Owner

The Product Owner collaborates with customers and other external stakeholders to help define the vision of what the product should look like and which features it should contain. The Product Owner then helps the development team by representing the customers and external stakeholders during the development process. They are there to help answer questions and offer feedback to the development team during key meetings such as Release Planning, Iteration Planning, and the Sprint Review.

The Product Owner is also in charge of the Product Backlog which contains user stories (descriptions of functionality from the user perspective) and other development items to help enable future work. Since the Product Owner is there to ensure the vision of the customer and external stakeholders, they set the priority of the backlog items. This means they must also work with other Product Owners to ensure there are no conflicting priorities among the teams, especially those who have dependencies upon one another.

The Product Owner is empowered by the business to say no to customer requests that may not be viable, too costly, or could cause too much stress on the development team. In this way, they are also an advocate for the Development Team and the business. To navigate these difficult discussions with customers and external stakeholders, a Product Owner must be knowledgeable about the business, the customer, and the market.

### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is a servant leader for the Scrum team. The act as a coach for the Development Team, guiding them towards practices that maintain quality, good communication, and accountability. The Scrum Master helps the team develop a _Team Working Agreement_ that sets out the values, principles, and practices that the team agree's to adhere to. They help the team identify ways of self-organizing to create a better cross-functional environment and allow for cognitive diversity to tackle difficult problems.

On occasion the Scrum Master will facilitate the meetings for a team, though this is not a duty that typically falls on the Scrum Master alone. Due to teams needing to be self-organized, this means they should also have facilitators that are picked or volunteered within the team.

The Scrum Master is also there to provide assistance to removing impediments to team progress. These impediments can exist both internally or externally to the team. In some cases pairings are suggested by the Scrum Master, or communication with other teams is required to check on the progress of certain tasks. They may resolve security related issues where team members may not have access to the tools they need to complete their work, or other technical and business blockers that exist outside the team. Quite often they help coordinate and set up meetings on behalf of the team and organization.

Perhaps the most important job of a Scrum Master is to create an environment that promotes an Agile mindset of iteration, growth, and open communication. They help maintain an emotional safe space for the Development Team to discuss important matters without a sense of reprisals. They are there to help create solutions to the group problems that go beyond a technical nature.

### Development Team

The Development Team consists of not just developers but any who is involved in the technical aspects of developing the product. This may include Quality Assurance personnel, database administrators, IT support, user experience designers, or other such skill based staff. These development teams should consist of no less than 3 and no more than 9 members. If there are fewer than 3 members of the development team then there is not enough cognitive diversity to ensure the quality of the product. If there are more than 9 members then communication between the members may become difficult and harder to stay organized.

The Development Teams should be self-organized, meaning they determine how they will conduct their work. They decide pairing partners, the size of the groups working on specific tasks, how their working space should be arranged, what the coding and other technical standards should be, and what the *Definition of Done* is.

The Development Team should be cross-functional and interdependent. This means the skills of the individuals on the team should compliment each other and not have too much overlap. Teams that are organized with all the same skills should be avoided. Ideally the team should have their work described as a piece of functionality that caters to a user need. These are typically called as *user stories*. The team should have the combined necessary skills to take that functionality from inception to delivery without the need to rely on other teams to help them complete it.

The Development Team should be co-located and long lived. This helps ensure team cohesion and an efficient work environment.

### !callout-warning
[Some study data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0263237313001618) suggests long-lived teams can become harmful to cognitive diversity as team members begin to think like one another after long enough exposure. The relationship of efficiency and longevity tends to be inversely curvilinear, meaning efficiency goes up to a certain point over time and then begins to go down as the group stays together longer.
