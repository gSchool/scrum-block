## Description

Scrum is a framework for project management that was developed by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber and revealed in 1995. Scrum emphasizes teamwork while doing project management and product building. It does this through various artifacts, job roles, practices, and ceremonies. Scrum promotes self-organized teams to deal with the difficulties of improvement and quality in software. Scrum also promotes accountability, iteration, and goal setting and ways to motivate teams to build quality products in a timely manner.

Scrum is considered an Agile framework despite being created before Agile was introduced. This is due to Scrums focus on an iterative process to gradually improve the product over time.  At times Scrum and Agile proponents disagree on whether or not Scrum is truly an Agile framework due to some of it's teachings regarding who is responsible for communicating with the customer, it's emphasis on dates to drive timelines, and the planning of work up front that is more strictly adhered to than other Agile frameworks. Despite these disagreements, Scrum is widely accepted as an Agile methodology and is among the most popular frameworks by larger enterprise organizations.

## 3 Primary job roles

The separation of responsibilities according to job roles is a key part of the Scrum framework. There are 3 job roles that Scrum mainly focuses on. These are:

* Product Owner
* Scrum Master
* Development Team

Later lessons in this unit will cover the responsibilities of each of these roles.


## Common practices

Some of the more common practices of Scrum are:

* User Stories
* Product Backlog
* Sprint planning
* Release planning
* Daily Scrum meeting
* Spring review with a Demo
* Retrospectives

Not all of these common practices are exclusive to Scrum. Many Agile teams who do not ascribe to Scrum will use some or even all of these practices, however they may have different names for them. For example, Sprint Planning may be called *Iteration Planning* or the Daily Scrum may be called the *Stand-Up*.
