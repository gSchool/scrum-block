# Instructor Notes

# Talking Points

(Specific points or technical details that, while not contained in Learn reading / CFUs, supplement student learning.)

# Failure Modes

Currently unknown; please update if you run into something (What can go wrong for an instructor, and how to fix them.)

# Lesson Plan

This unit contains both complete content within the lessons and a slide deck. The slide deck has several videos included that can be given to the students to watch (DO NOT PLAY THEM TO THE GROUP), or the instructor can use the bullet points in the slide deck as talking points to use in a lecture. There is also plenty of self-guided material in the lessons which allow for a flipped classroom experience. There are CFU's at the end of each lesson and a checkpoint at the end of the unit which can be used for cold calling after a lecture, or simply have the students answer themselves and submit.

If there are at least 5 students in the class, they can perform Exercise One.
