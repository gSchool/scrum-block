# Perform a mock sprint

You and your team have been given a green light to design a new product for the banking organization you work at. They don't really care what the product is so long as it is valuable to the company.

Using the roles and practices of Scrum, perform the following with a group of at least 5 people:

*Assigning Roles*
1. Assign a Product Owner
2. Assign a Scrum Master
3. Designate the rest of the team as developers
4. Conduct a release planning meeting to add user stories to a backlog using either GitHub or GitLab issues
   1. Prioritize these user stories as a part of your release planning meeting
   2. Determine how many stories are necessary to make a minimum viable product
   3. Product Owner can veto any decisions the team makes based on customer value
5. Conduct a sprint planning meeting to story point and select some items from the backlog that your team believes would take 2 weeks to finish
   1. Estimate how many more sprints it will take to reach product viability
6. Conduct 10 Daily Scrum meetings with one random member of the development team not there each time to simulate absences
   1. No progress on that person's task or any tasks that depend on that person's task can be made on the days they are out
   2. Scrum Master may come up with a solution to solve for absences
7. By the end of your sprint (10 daily scrum meetings) calculate how many story points your team would have completed
8. Perform a Retrospective on the team's performance of the mock product
9.  Repeat steps 5 through 8 as many times as you need to complete the stories required for a minimum viable product
10. Count how many sprints it took to reach product viability
